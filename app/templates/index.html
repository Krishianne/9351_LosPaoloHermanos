                Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques</h1>

                <p>Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the 
                    world and plays a vital role in many national economies, 
                    including that of the Philippines (PCAARRD, n.d.). 
                    Its global demand has given rise to a highly 
                    competitive industry where quality assessment is essential 
                    in maintaining standards across the supply chain. 
                    One important aspect of this process is coffee bean grading, 
                    a systematic approach to evaluating coffee quality that enables producers, 
                    traders, and consumers to align expectations and ensure fair 
                    market practices (Zwart, 2021). Coffee grade directly influences a product's 
                    market value, consumer appeal, and standing in international trade.</p>

            <div class="article-2-text">
                Traditionally, coffee grading is carried out through manual inspection, where trained 
                professionals assess beans based on characteristics such as size, color, and the presence 
                of defects (Jayakumari et al., 2024). While effective to a degree, this approach is time-consuming, 
                labor-intensive, and often subject to human error and variability in judgment. 
                As the coffee industry continues to grow and demand for high-quality beans increases, 
                there is a pressing need for more efficient, consistent, and objective methods of quality classification.

                India is one of the few countries globally that cultivates all four major commercially viable coffee varieties: 
                Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, and Excelsa. The country's diverse topography and agro-climatic zones from lowland 
                tropical areas to high-altitude hills create ideal conditions for cultivating a variety of coffee types 
                (Coffee Board of India, 2024). Wayanad, located in the state of Kerala, stands out as one of India's key 
                coffee-producing regions. Its rich red laterite soil, moderate to high elevation, and favorable rainfall 
                patterns are particularly conducive to the production of high-quality Arabica and Robusta beans, 
                which are well-suited for specialty coffee markets (Bipin et al., 2025). Arabica, known for its nuanced flavor profile, 
                mild acidity, and lower caffeine content, remains the most prized variety in these regions.

                Despite the increasing global demand for specialty coffee, the Indian coffee industry faces a significant challenge 
                in maintaining consistent bean grading practices, particularly at the smallholder level. The grading of Arabica beans 
                involves assessing attributes such as size, shape, color, and defect count, all of which play a critical role in determining 
                marketability and pricing (International Coffee Organization, 2023). However, in regions like Wayanad, many small-scale farmers 
                still rely on manual sorting and traditional techniques. These methods often result in inconsistent quality assessments, 
                limiting the competitiveness of Indian coffee in international markets (Bipin et al., 2025). Furthermore, limited access to 
                advanced grading technologies exacerbates this issue, preventing farmers from realizing the full potential of their produce.

                Currently, coffee beans are sorted using either manual or mechanical methods. Manual sorting relies on trained workers who visually 
                inspect the beans for defects and quality, but this process is prone to errors due to fatigue, inadequate training, and human variability. 
                While mechanical sorting machines can classify beans by size, they cannot assess visual defects accurately and may damage the beans through 
                rough handling (Garcia et al., 2019). This variation in grading methods leads to subjective assessments, further complicating the consistency 
                and reliability of quality grading in the industry.
