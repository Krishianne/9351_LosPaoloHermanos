        <h2>Grade-A, Grade-AA, Grade-AAA, Grade-AB, Grade-C:</h2>
        <p>These grades represent the different levels of quality which is determined by a coffee beanâ€™s size and number of defects. 
            The higher grade (Grade-AAA) indicates that the coffee bean has a larger size with minimal defects. 
            In contrast, lower grade (Grade-C) indicates that the coffee bean has a smaller size and more defects (Sucaf ina: Plantation AA, n.d.-b).</p>

            PB-I coffee beans are considered as a higher-quality grade, while PB-II refers to a lower-quality grade (Sucaf ina: Plantation AA, n.d.-b).</p>
